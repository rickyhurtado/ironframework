Ironframework
=============

The Ironframework is designed by [Ironcoder](https://www.facebook.com/Ironcoder) using the latest front end technologies such as jQuery, RequireJS, Underscore, Backbone, EmbeddedJS (EJS) and other JS libraries and plugins.

### Is this a new framework?
The Ironframework is _not a new framework_ - it's just a simple implementation of Require and Backbone JS libraries for dynamic loading of JS modules or files. The highlights of this framework can be found under the library folder. There you'll find the modules that are very useful in the application development. The library modules also provide better user experience (UX) utilizing the local storage. Another highlight  of this framework is the SSE library module for server-sent event implementation with AJAX long polling method as fallback.

### Is that all?
The Ironframework is very new and there are plenty of room for improvements. Contributors are very much welcome here. The documentation of this framework will be available soon. Although most of the implementations were properly documented as comments - the rest are self explanatory. Use this framework to your projects at your own risk.

### So what's next?
The Ironframework will be available soon with the MVC backend frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Laravel, CodeIgniter and Zend Framework 2 for the dynamic selection of JS modules. Top front end frameworks will also be used such as Twitter Bootstrap, Foundation and jQuery Mobile.
